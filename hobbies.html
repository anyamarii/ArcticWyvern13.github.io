    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>The items on this shelf include medals, music equipment, and other tools and items involved in my hobbies. Any kind of extracurricular or project I do, all have helped shape me into the person I am today, helping me develop skills and knowledge applicable outside of whatever it is I’m doing. Any hands-on projects, doing mechanics or building things, all have skills that can be applied to similar projects and help me to develop ways to get things to work. My music creates a sense of community, and working on working with others, with everyone in the band having an equally important role in creating beautiful music, as well as being a stress reliever as music is peaceful to me. Lastly, my sports; mainly football, wrestling, and rugby; but also any other sports I play for fun have led to me having a strong work ethic and communication skills. With wrestling especially, due to the individualistic nature of the sport, it's just as much a mental battle as it is physical one, however supportive teammates and encouraging coaches all lead to my success in building skills that I can carry throughout my life.
