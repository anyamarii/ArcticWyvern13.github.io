    <h1>Brother</h1>
    <p>This item being out of stock represents how Jung, Janet's brother, left home young, leaving Janet to bear more responsibilities and connections with her family. If Jung had stayed, there would have been less pressure on Janet to continue what Appa sees as his only dynasty, his story, that must be carried on. However, with Jung gone, this is all placed on Janet, even if it isn’t what she wants to do. What to Appa seems as a waste of her life, all their effort put in and expecting her to be a doctor, or a lawyer, wasn’t a waste at all, instead providing her with the opportunity to live her own life. At the end of the play, Jung comes back to Appa and takes over the store, preserving Appa’s story while also allowing Janet to continue hers, and Appa also realizes through his grandson that no matter what, he should still be proud of his children.</p>
