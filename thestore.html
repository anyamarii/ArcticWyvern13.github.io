    <h1>The Store</h1>
    <p>On this shelf, there are some typical convenience store items, meant to represent the store itself and how that impacted Janet’s life. The store and Appa’s dedication to it strongly affected Janet and how she grew up, especially with the differences in ideas between her and her father. Since he came to Canada, his whole life has been dedicated to building a good life for himself and his family, through his store, and everything he does is for them. Janet doesn’t always see this, nor fully appreciate it, but there is a part in the play where Appa brings it to light, how everything was always for her and her brother to have the best life he can provide with what they have. All the effort Appa puts into his business means Janet was free to explore all of her own hobbies, from sports when she was younger to now pursuing photography as an adult, even if it's not fully accepted.
