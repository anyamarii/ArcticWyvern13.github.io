    <h1>Friends</h1>
    <p>Symbolizing friends with just one thing is difficult, with each relationship with each person in your life being defined differently. That's why this shelf has an assortment of items, each representing different things I have in common with people in my life whether it's our dedication to academics, crochet, music, baking etc. In the picture is anyone I have met in my life, whether they are still in my life now, were in the past, or may be met in the future, as each and every one of them has impacted my story, no matter how minimally, and have led to the path I’m on today. Some people teach through mistakes, maybe I shouldn’t have been friends with them and it ended up hurting me, but it helps me avoid similar things in the future. Others help provide other perspectives on life and certain situations, helping me to develop a wider worldview and to be more understanding of those around me. No matter who they are, I’m thankful for each person I’ve met and who has contributed to my story.
