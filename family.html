    <h1>Family</h1>
    <p>On this shelf there is a Portugal flag and a family picture, meant to symbolize the importance of my family in my life. Some people are closer than others with their families, and that has an impact in their lives, but by having a fairly close knit family, I picked up a lot of values and ideas held by family members. However, they aren’t always ideal, with some people holding ideas that perhaps aren’t the greatest or are controversial. This in a way also impacted how I think, by being more open to other people's perspectives and realizing not everyone will have great ideas to be followed, but everyone should be open to their own ideas. With my culture, I unfortunately can no longer speak my first language, which has slightly distanced me from some feeling of Portuguese community. However, I have been working more on exploring my culture and getting back to it, regaining lost opportunities from before.
