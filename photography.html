    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <p>This shelf has a camera, a box of memory cards and other camera accessories, as well as a family photo. Similar to the other aspects of her life, her perusal of photography symbolizes how the hard work of her Appa and Umma opened up so many more opportunities for her, where she doesn’t entirely have to focus on money and just helping with the store, but can instead find her own story. While photography may seem like a waste of time to him for quite awhile, it can be inferred near the end, while he is talking to Jung about his child's pursuit into the NHL, that he realizes that even if he doesn't reach that, or that if Janet doesn’t become a doctor or a similar profession, then it doesn’t matter, and that it was due to his hard work that Janet doesn’t have to, and she can focus on the photography she enjoys.
